## Hi! My name is Aibis Khan, I'm 17, and I live in NYC. I'm an upcoming college freshman majoring in psychology. I hope to learn the basics of and build a foundation for multiple coding languages, as well as to collaborate with my peers so that we can learn together :)

## About me:
I enjoy spending time with friends, going to the gym, playing video games, and watching media while snacking. I'm very interested in psychology, and I'm always down to have philosophical conversations. I also have the cutest kitty in the entire world!

## Education & Work:
I recently graduated from high school. I don't have very much coding experience, but two summers ago, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during a week-long coding bootcamp that was through my college prep program. I used all three languages to make a simple website in collaboration with a partner. Though I've forgotten most of what I've learned, I am still familiar with the languages, and I wish to build on them further.
